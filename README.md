## Getting Started

To start using Shorty's Rescue on your own computer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: To "clone" means to make another one of something. In this situation, "cloning" means to make another one of Shorty's Rescue on your own computer.
   
   git clone https://github.com/okrayum/Shorty-s-Rescue.git

2. Install dependencies for the client: "Install" sets up or adds something to your computer for use. "Dependencies" are more things that Shorty's Rescue needs to work as usual. In this case, "client" is where the frontend part of Shorty's Rescue is. The frontend of Shorty's Rescue will be the part you see and use with things like forms, and pictures.
   
   cd client
   
   npm install

3. From the client folder start the frontend:
   
   npm run start

This will only let you see the *frontend* of  Shorty's Rescue at this time. Forms will not work. You will not have use of the "Admin" side.
